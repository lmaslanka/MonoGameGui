# MonoGameGui
MonoGame GUI is a library for providing graphical user interface controls for use in your game. This is an early start for the library and right now I only have skeleton code for displaying a window and moving it around inside the game window.

## Future Plans v1

1. Window with customizable appearance and a container for other controls
2. TextBox for taking user input
3. Button for taking user input
4. Events model for responding to UI events
